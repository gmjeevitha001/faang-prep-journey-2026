## Topics Covered
- Time & Space Complexity
- Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ
- Arrays basics
- Prefix Sum concept

## Problems Solved
1. Running Sum of 1D Array
   - Brute Force: O(n²)
   - Optimized: O(n)
2. Richest Customer Wealth

## Learnings
- Optimization comes after brute force
- Reusing previous computation saves time
- Nested loops don’t always mean n² blindly

## Struggles
- Needed hints initially
- Felt mentally exhausted by end of day

## Reflection
Today was hard emotionally, but foundational.
Did not quit. That matters.

## Tomorrow Plan
